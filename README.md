## To Do

- [ ] Crop the images around the object
- [ ] Display victory message and stop animation when all players are one type
- [ ] Some collisions arent changing the losing object
- [ ] Slow it down a bit to make the bouncing animations a bit smoother
- [ ] Crashes when left for a while- 
- [ ] When one team has no players left it crashes
